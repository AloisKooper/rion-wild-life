# Tour Images for Rion Wildlife Safaris

This directory is where you should place images for the tour cards and featured tours on the website.

## Required Images

The following images should be added to this directory:

1. `namibia-highlights.jpeg` - Image representing the Namibia Highlights Safari
2. `namwild.jpeg` - Image for the Namwild Safari
3. `victoria-falls.jpeg` - Image for the Victoria Falls Adventure tour

## Image Requirements

- Image dimensions should be consistent, preferably 600x660px (for tour cards)
- Images should be high-quality and showcase the best aspects of each tour
- Consider using images that show both landscapes and wildlife when possible
- Images should be optimized for web to maintain fast loading times

## Status

âœ… All required images have been added to this directory.

## Temporary Solution

Until you add your own images, the website may show placeholder images or broken links.
You can use stock photos initially, but we recommend replacing them with authentic photos from your
safari experiences when available.
