# Activity Images for Rion Wildlife Safaris

This directory is where you should place images for the Activities Section on the website.

## Required Images

The following images should be added to this directory:

1. `etosha-wildlife.jpeg` - A photo showing wildlife in Etosha National Park (elephants, lions, or rhinos)
2. `desert-exploration.jpeg` - Image of the Namib desert or Sossusvlei sand dunes
3. `cultural-experiences.jpeg` - Photo showing cultural interactions with local communities
4. `victoria-falls.jpeg` - Image of Victoria Falls
5. `photography.jpeg` - Safari photography/photo safari image
6. `okavango-delta.jpeg` - Image of the Okavango Delta, preferably with mokoro canoes

## Image Requirements

- Image dimensions should be consistent, preferably 800x500px (16:10 ratio)
- High-quality, professionally taken photos work best
- Images should be optimized for web to maintain fast loading times

## Temporary Solution

Until you add your own images, the website may show placeholder images or broken links.
You can use stock photos initially, but we recommend replacing them with authentic photos from your
safari experiences when available.
